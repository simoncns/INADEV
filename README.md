Instructions:
=============================================================================================================================================
Software Development:
    1. Create a simple UI using any front-end technology to accept the zip code of a location

    2. Create a microservice that provides the current weather for a given location. It can be either a simple web page or a REST endpoint. (You can obtain the weather from a free API like https://open-meteo.com/). You may use any of the following languages to create the service: JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, or C#.

    3. Integrate the UI from Step 1 with the microservice in Step 2

    4. Please consider the best practices around exception handling, logging, and anything else that should be done for Production Ready applications.
 

Deployment:
    1. Containerize the code using Docker and run the code locally on your laptop using Docker Desktop. **OPTIONAL - If you can, deploy the code on an EC2 instance on AWS. AWS Free tier instances should suffice
    
    2. Launch the web application using a browser and demonstrate the functionality
